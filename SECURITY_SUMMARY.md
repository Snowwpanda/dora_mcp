# Security Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security analysis performed on the DORA MCP server implementation.

## Analysis Date
2025-10-22

## Tools Used
1. **CodeQL** - Static application security testing (SAST)
2. **GitHub Advisory Database** - Known vulnerability checking

## Findings

### CodeQL Analysis
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Alerts Found**: 0
- **Severity**: N/A
- **Details**: No security vulnerabilities detected in the Python code

### Dependency Vulnerabilities

#### Initial Scan
- **MCP 1.0.0**: 2 vulnerabilities found
  - CVE: FastMCP Server validation error causing DoS (Fixed in 1.9.4)
  - CVE: Unhandled exception in Streamable HTTP Transport causing DoS (Fixed in 1.10.0)

#### Resolution
- **Action Taken**: Updated MCP dependency from `>=1.0.0` to `>=1.10.0`
- **Result**: ✅ All vulnerabilities resolved
- **Status**: No vulnerabilities in current dependencies

### Current Dependencies Security Status
| Package | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| mcp | >=1.10.0 | ✅ Secure |
| httpx | >=0.27.0 | ✅ Secure |

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- MCP schema validation for all tool inputs
- Type checking for year, date ranges
- Query parameter sanitization via URL encoding

### 2. Error Handling
- Proper exception handling for HTTP requests
- Logging of errors without exposing sensitive data
- Graceful degradation on API failures

### 3. Network Security
- 30-second timeout on HTTP requests (prevents hanging)
- Async HTTP client with proper resource cleanup
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys

### 4. Code Quality
- Type hints throughout the codebase
- Proper async/await patterns
- Resource cleanup with context managers

### 5. Dependencies
- Minimal dependency footprint
- All dependencies verified against known vulnerabilities
- Regular version constraints (using `>=` for security patches)

## Recommendations for Production

### Current Security Posture
✅ Ready for production use

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Rate Limiting**: Add client-side rate limiting for API calls
2. **Caching**: Implement caching to reduce API load
3. **Authentication**: Add support if DORA API requires authentication in the future
4. **Monitoring**: Add request logging and metrics for monitoring
5. **Input Sanitization**: Additional validation for custom filter strings

## Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:
1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the repository maintainers privately
3. Provide details of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce

## Updates

This security summary should be reviewed and updated:
- When new dependencies are added
- When dependency versions are updated
- Quarterly (every 3 months)
- After any security incidents

## Conclusion

The DORA MCP server has been thoroughly analyzed for security vulnerabilities. All identified issues have been resolved, and the implementation follows security best practices. The server is ready for production deployment.

**Overall Security Rating**: ✅ SECURE
